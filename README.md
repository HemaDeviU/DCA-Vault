## Future Plans

We aim to enhance Money Plant by expanding its capabilities to support cross-chain investments. Our future plans include:


**Cross-Chain Investments:** Enable users to add funds on one blockchain and invest across different chain tokens by leveraging the power of Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).

**Enhanced Liquidity Pools:** Integrate additional liquidity pools across multiple chains to maximize user returns and diversify investment opportunities.

**Advanced Automation:** Implement more sophisticated automation strategies for DCA and profit realization, making the platform even more user-friendly and efficient.

**User-Friendly Interface:** Develop a more intuitive and interactive user interface to simplify cross-chain investment management.

**Security Enhancements:** Continuously improve the security measures to protect user funds and ensure safe cross-chain transactions.


These enhancements will provide users with greater flexibility, broader investment opportunities, and a seamless experience across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

Money Plant aims to simplify and automate the investment process for users, combining the benefits of regular DCA with the ability to automatically realize profits based on market conditions. With the integration of Aave, Uniswap, and Chainlink, Money Plant provides a robust and efficient platform for decentralized investment strategies.
